        I am a 4 year old English Bulldog puppy born and raised all over the United States.
        My dad bought when he was a senior in college so I spent a year in Ithaca. Then we moved to 
        Dallas so my dad could work and pay for all my toys. Our family lives in El Paso which is 
        where I was born so my dad and I spend a lot of time there too.
        <br><br>
        I like to wrestle with my dad, go to the park, and eat. Oh boy do I love to eat. My favorite 
        treat is a piece of red meat cooked out on the grill. My dad tries to limit how many treats 
        I eat because if it were up to me I'd eat treats all day so a lot of times I'll follow my 
        grandpa around because he gives me treats the most. Also, he weirdly looks like me too...</p>
